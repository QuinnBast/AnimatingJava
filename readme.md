Welcome to Chess in Java by Quinn Bast!

This is a side-project of mine where I am practicing my java skills while also learning about GUIs.
The completed project will include a fully functional chess board that will include 2 player local play chess.
If I am ambitious I may attempt to code an AI that you can play against at a later date.

I have implemented EnPassant, Castling, Checkmate detection, Stalemate detection.

To Implement: 
- Stalemate by insufficient material
- Stalemate by 50 moves no captures
- Stalemate by threefold repetition.
- Material value (pawn = 1, knight = 3, etc.)
- Request to draw
- Optional added Turn timer
- Highlight possible moves for selected pieces for beginners

From working on this project I have learnt the following concepts:

- Using Swing libaray in Java (JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, ImageIcon, etc.)
- Using OOP to create  GUI
- Managing click events in Java
- Effective use of static variables to make life easy
- Game Design
  - GameState, GameBoard
  - Special Chess Logic
