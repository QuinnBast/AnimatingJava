Welcome to Chess in Java by Quinn Bast!

This is a side-project of mine where I am practicing my java skills while also learning about GUIs.
The completed project will include a fully functional chess board that will include 2 player local play chess.
If I am ambitious I may attempt to code an AI that you can play against at a later date.

From working on this project I have learnt the following concepts:

*Using Swing libaray in Java (JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, ImageIcon, etc.)
*Using OOP to create  GUI
*Managing click events in Java
*Effective use of static variables to make life easy
*Integrating graphics into Java
